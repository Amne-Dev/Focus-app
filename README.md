# 🎯 Focus App 

A fullscreen, system-wide input-blocking focus timer with optional Spotify integration.  
Made with Python and CustomTkinter for a modern experience.  

✅ Designed for productivity  
✅ Blocks distractions  
✅ Clean fullscreen UI  
✅ Spotify track display (optional)
⚠ Im gonna rework the Music Tracking in a future release as Spotify doesn't allow developper anymore to have a production key (it requires 250k monthly users) before you can requet to publish with a production key There for the app will only support the timer and the music tracking will only be for a select few [Thanks for understanding ♥]
